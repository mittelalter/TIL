* When Histogram is symmetic, then mean and median are same.

# Probability
* **Complement rule**: P(A does not occur) = 1 - P(A)
* **Rule for equally likely outcomes**: If there are n possible outcomes and they are equally likely, then P(A) = number of outcomes in A / n
* **Addition rule**: A = 1, b = 6, C = 1, A and B are mutually exclusive but A and C are not. If A and B are mutually exclusive, then P(A **or** B) = P(A) + P(B). Two events are independent if konwing that one occurs does not change the probability that the other occurs. 
    * The probability of both events happening at the same time is zero.
    * They cannot occur at the same time.
    * A good example is flipping a coin.
* **Multiple**: If A **and** B are independent, then P(A and B) = P(A) P(B)
    * We can use the general multiplication rule for independent events.\
