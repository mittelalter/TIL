## Ask
* A well-written business task provides me with a clear purpose when cleaning and analyzing data. It also helps me prioritize the types of visualizations to create and fine-tune the content of your final presentation.


## Prepare
* The credibility of the data has a big impact on my credibility with stakeholders. Information about my data should be readily available and clearly communicated so stakeholders know I'm using high-quality data. 


## Process
* Data analysts are always thinking about how to improve their data analysis documentation skills. Reviewing my documentation sparks new ways of thinking and can highlight where there might be a mistake. This ensures me data-driven recommendations are sound.

## Analyze
* A compelling summary of my data analysis demonstrates that I understand the data, can identify how it relates to the business case, and are sharing what I've found in the best possible way.

## Share
* As a data analyst, itâ€™s important that my visualization skills keep evolving with the changes in technology and design. Reviewing and critiquing my own work provides many opportunities for growth and development.

## Act
* The act of asking myself to come up with two more ideas can reveal recommendations that I had not thought of before.
