    * Named Ranges
        * Named Ranges are a way to give a memorable name to a single cell or range of cells. You can then   use this Named Range in formulas where it functions like an absolute cell reference. It can also make your formulas more readable because the name has more meaning than a cell reference. For example, =N4*Pension_Rate is more meaningful than =N4*$P$2.
